    "This script uploads all files from a specified local folder (e.g., on your Desktop)\n",
    "to CAIRN's Backblaze B2 bucket and lists the uploaded files.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Install Libraries:**\n",
    "    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:\n",
    "    pip install python-dotenv b2sdk\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Create `.env` File:**\n",
    "    In the SAME directory where you save this Python script, create a file named exactly `.env` (note the leading dot). Open it in a text editor and add your Backblaze B2 Application Key ID, Application Key, and the exact name of the bucket you want to upload to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    B2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY_ID  \n",
    "    B2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY  \n",

    "\n",
    "    Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials and bucket name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Set the Local Folder Path:**\n",
    "    Find the line below that starts with `LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH = ...`  \n",
    "    Modify the path to point to the *exact* folder on your computer that contains the files you want to upload.  Utilize an LLM For clarity if confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Set B2 Folder Prefix (Optional):**\n",
    "    If you want the files to appear inside a specific 'folder' within your B2 bucket, change `B2_FOLDER_PREFIX`.   \n",
    "    For example: B2_FOLDER_PREFIX = \"project_files/january/\"\n",
    "    Leave as \"\" to upload to the bucket's root.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Run the Script:**\n",
    "    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved this script and the `.env` file, and run: python your_script_name.py or run as a juypter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Check Output:**\n",
    "    The script will log its progress in the terminal, including connection status, which files it's uploading, and a final summary listing thesuccessfully uploaded files (with their names as they appear in B2).\n"
